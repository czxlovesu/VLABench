Please provide the poker rules for the scenario you've designed, such as Dou Dizhu, Texas Hold'em, etc.\n Our task requirements are related to the characteristics of the target object, focusing on specific flavors.  \n Create tasks that reflect real-life scenarios where the need for the object is implied through casual, everyday observations. \n Ensure that the scenarios and tones are diverse, reflecting different conversational contexts such as party.   \n Do not include terms like card_holder1, which are not commonly used in real life, in the instruction.\n For example:  'target_object: 6_of_clubs, instruction: 'I'm playing Dou Dizhu, and I have three 6s in my hand; I'd like to make a bomb combination.'' \n Please provide the task following the format of the above example.\n The target_object must be the target entity. \n Please provide ten tasks that meet the above requirements and format, ensuring that the instructions use a variety of conversational tones and scenarios to reflect different everyday situations."
